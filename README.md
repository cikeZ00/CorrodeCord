# Disproportion
A re-implementstion of the discord client in Rust/Flutter

## Why?
I wanted to do a proper project in Rust to learn the ins and outs of the language.

Another reason was that Discord keeps pushing useless updates to both their desktop and mobile clients which annoyed me.

So I decided to have a go at writing my own client that's personalized to my needs.

## Goals
- [ ] Basic client functionality
- [ ] Basic UI
- [ ] Voice chat


## Building
```bash
TODO
```

## Running
```bash
TODO
